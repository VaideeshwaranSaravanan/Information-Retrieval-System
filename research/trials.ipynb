      "hello guys my name is B hammed and welcome to my course so guys in this video we'll be implementing one end to end genbi project called ENT medical chatbot so I think you already know what is medical chatbot let's say if you have any medical related query let's say you got one disease so you are asking for the diagnosis you are asking for the medicine so this bot will able to give the response with respect to that that means it will give you the suggestion it will give you the medicine suggestion it will give you the diagnosis suggestion so these kinds of information this bot will provide so we'll be creating the complete system here that means here first of all we'll be using our custom data the entire let's say medical information custom data we'll be using first of all we'll be teaching our model we'll be creating the entire knowledge base then I'm going to connect my large language model there that means whatever information you'll be asking related the medical let's say any kinds of disease any kinds of medicine any kinds of let's say diagnosis so everything your chatbot will be able to give you the response okay so this is the system we'll be implementing and this is not going to be guys uh like notebook implementation so here we'll be creating the complete pipeline that means we'll be creating the front end part of our application that means we'll be creating the beautiful user interface so that user can put the query and they can get the response from the chat bar fine and here we'll be using something called modular coding in Python so it's not like scripting programming we'll be writing we'll be using modular concept here to implement the entire project fine and also we'll be uh using the git and GitHub to let's say do the version controlling so uh that means we'll be following the entire development pipeline here what are the things things you need even I will also show you how we can deploy this project okay in a cloud platform so everything guys we'll be implementing in this project so make sure you're watching this video till the end and if you have any question you can feel free to ask me okay in the comment section so first of all what I will show you guys I will show you the entire project architecture like what are the things we are going to develop then I will also show you the tools and Technology we'll be using here then we'll start the implementation fine so let's open up our Blackboard and try to understand the project architecture so guys as I already told you we'll be using our custom data here okay we'll be using custom data custom Medical Data I can write medical data so let me show you I'm having one entire actually medical book so guys you can see this is the book the book name is the G Encyclopedia of medicine okay second edition so this is the book you can also search on Google you will get this book and it is having uh around 637 Pages it's like very uh big book and it is having all kinds of information regarding the medical so see if you open this book actually you will see all kinds of content let's say all kinds of disease even with respect to that disease what kinds of medicine actually you need what kinds of diagnosis technique you need everything this book has uh covered okay so it is having different different um different different treatment different different uh actually medicine different different disease even the disease image is also visible here all kinds of disease actually it is having all kinds of disease actually it is having even with respect to that they have also given the diagnosis even the treatment okay how let's say you can do the diagnosis how you can do the treatment what kinds of medicine you have to let's say take everything this book has uh given the information so here we'll be using this book actually the entire medical information and we'll be creating the knowledge base that means here we'll be using pine cone Vector database okay I think you know Pine con is a cloud-based Vector database that means there we can store the embedding Vector embedding that means first of all we'll be extracting all the information from this book then we'll be creating the chunks and that chunks actually with the help of embedding model we'll be creating the vector embedding and that Vector embedding will be storing to the pine cone Vector DB and that Pine con Vector DB is going to be my knowledge base that means the entire knowledge base H why I'm not using the local Vector database here because my data size is huge if you see 637 Pages information I'm having so if you just create the chunks just try to consider how many chunks you will get and if you're storing in the local DB it won't be efficient so that that's why we'll be using cloud-based Vector DV here fine and I'll will show you how we can use the pine cone properly it's one of the amazing Vector DV when I personally prefer so there actually you can also see your vector visualization okay everything you can see see this is another actually disease see this is the disease actually even with respect to that they have also given the diagnosis as well as the medicine now I'll share this PDF with you guys you can uh see The Complete Book if you want to see different different medicine and different different let's say diagnosis okay you can check it out so here what we'll be doing guys we'll be using this medic book so let's say this is one PDF documents actually I'm having or here I can write medical okay medical book so from the medical book what we'll do we'll just extract all the information extract all docks okay then after that we'll be creating different different chunks and I think you know what is chunking is required right because here we'll be using large language model and large language model is having input uh actually size one specific input size and we have to follow that input size I think previously we learn about llama llama is having 4,096 okay this is the input length uh that means this is the maximum input length it can take the data if you're using open a model Also let's say GPT okay GPT is also having one specific input lend if you want to see that just open the open.com and go to the model section you will see that GPT input l so whatever actually large language model you are using first of all try to see the input length Okay of that model like what would be the maximum token size based on that try try to perform the chunking operation okay that should be my suggestion now it will give me different different chunks so let's say I will get chunk one the chunk one we'll be getting Chun two we'll be getting chunk three and so on then after getting the chunks what I have to do guys I'll be using one embeding model embedding model okay with this embedding model we'll generate the vector embedding okay it will give me different different Vector embedding you'll be getting Vector embedding I can copy and I can paste it here so we'll be getting different different Vector embedding and with this Vector embedding guys what we'll do we'll just try to build one centic index that means the knowledge base right build centic index so this is going to be my knowledge base that means we'll be storing this Vector to the vector database so I can write knowledge base okay knowledge base and here we'll be using something called Pine con Vector store okay so let's me just write VOR DB okay DB VOR DB and guys uh this is going to be my complete backend comp component okay so here I can write this is going to be my backend component okay component now I have to work on the front end component that means user will uh give some query and with respect to the quy actually uh I have to uh give the proper response okay let's say this is the user this is the user so user will send one query let's say this is the query user has asked so first of all it will convert to the query embedding okay query embedding that means this is going to be a English text right and that should also converted to the vector embedding this Vector embedding will go to the knowledge base okay it will go to the knowledge base and knowledge base will return some rank results okay rank result or similar let's say result it will return return okay rank results then I'll be using one large language model so here we'll be using one large language model llm so here I'm going to use openi large language model you can use any kinds of large language model you can use open source large language model okay you can also use the Gin you can also use uh let's say Mistral anything you can use here so here I'm going to use open large language model because here I'm going to create a production ready application so this application will be also deploying in the cloud platform okay that's why uh I'll be using openi model okay why openi model because openi model is already hosted in the openi server we can access this model through API request but if I'm using any open source L language model we have to download this model in our local machine and local machine doesn't have like good configuration let's say instance let's say you don't have good configuration GPU you don't have good configuration actually Ram CPU that time actually you can't execute this model in your system okay it it will be very much difficult for you and you will see that inference time would be also very high that means uh this modu will keep processing the input it will take lots of time to give you the response so that's why we'll be using openi model and going forward I'll be discussing about llm Ops and there I'll tell you how we can also use like different different open source large language model let's say if I want to use Lama okay llama if I want to let's say use mistal Falcone okay cloudy any kinds of model if I want to use how I can use it even how we can use it use it as a efficient way even how we can deploy these are the model in the cloud platform so for this we'll be using something called llm ops okay llm Ops we'll be using that means we'll be using different different platform we'll be running about Bedrock okay AWS Bedrock we'll be learning about let's say gcp vertex AI vertex so these are the llm Ops platform okay so we'll be uh using this lmos platform to access these are the model and on top of that we'll be creating the application f so this is what actually we'll be explaining later on guys so first of all try to see how we can implement this production ready project with the help of open AI model and there is another uh reason actually we are using openi model because if I uh let's say if I'm using open source large language model you will see that open source large language model size would be very huge let's say around 10 GB 20 GB and this model you can't execute in your local uh machine that means your low configuration machine and if you're deploying this project to the cloud platform there you have to take good instance that means you have to take GPU based instance with higher Ram higher CPU higher GPU and just try to consider about the cost like how much how much cost actually it will take that cloud platform you can go to any kinds of cloud platform you can see their uh instance actually type if you're taking GPU based instance type with higher Ram higher let say CPU you'll see that per hour it will cost you like more amount of money okay so again you are increasing the cost here whenever you are using open source large language model okay without any kinds of LM Ops tool LM Ops platform you will get the difficulty for sh right so that's why we will be using here openi model although it will charge you but it will charge you less than uh the open source model actually you'll be hosting in future okay this is the idea here so now what will happen this rank results will go to the llm even this quy also will go to the llm and llm will process L will try to understand the query as well as the rank results whatever results actually your knowledge Bas is returning based on that it will give you the correct response okay correct response or you can talk about answer correct answer let's say you are asking one question let's say I got Fe what can I do so it will first of all refer the knowledge base it will try to find out the let's say fever diagnosis fever medicine then with respect to that it will give you the um response got it so this is the entire system actually will be implementing and this is what actually our front end so this is what actually our front end many people also ask me like sir uh just try to create some application with the help of good front end development as well so that's why I also kept this front end development here we'll be creating one beautiful user interface so that user can give the qu here I think you use the chat GPT chat GPT is having one beautiful user interface okay so you'll be also creating these kinds of chatbot kinds of interface so that user can give any kind of query and they can get the response fine so this is the entire architecture of our project guys okay I hope it is clear now now technology wise I already told you here we'll be using uh large language model openi OKAY openi llm will'll be using then here we'll be using Lang chin as a Genera framework to develop the entire project then here we'll be using Vector database wise Pine con okay Pine con is a cloud uh cloud-based Vector database okay so there actually you can create a um instance and you can store your vector and here to create the user interface we'll be using something called flask okay flask is a python framework you can create web application okay with that got it uh yeah so I hope these are the actually technology we'll be using as of now and if I need it anything I'll tell you okay later on now guys what I to do guys uh first of all let's create one uh yeah so let me also write we'll be also using GitHub okay GitHub to do the version controlling of our entire application fine and later on we'll be also deploying this project to the AWS Cloud okay AWS Cloud so we'll be learning about the simple deployment as well as the cicd deployment okay both will be learning so guys this is the entire agenda so now let's open up our GitHub and try to create one GitHub repository first of all with our project then we'll be starting with the implementation fine so I'll go to my GitHub guys so this is my GitHub you can also follow me here I have created lots of repository that might help you a lot so just go to the repository and here uh create one new repository and give the name let's to create a medical um I'll just write end to end okay medical chatbot Genera VI so this is my repo name you can give any repon name as for your requirement now I'll be keeping as a public repository because I want to uh share this code with you so everyone can see that I'll will add the readme file as well as I will add the dog ignore file so here I'll be using Python Programming I'll be selecting the python let's take the license you can take any license I'll be taking Amit license now everything is fine now let's create the repository okay now let's CL the repository I'll copy the link address make sure youve selected HTTP 1 Now open up your local folder so let me open up my local folder and here I'll open up my terminal you can open up your let's say G bash you can open up your anacon anything and just write the command get clone and press the link here so it will clone that repository in your local machine now see it has clone now let me go inside this folder you can see currently I'm inside Lang chain project okay now I want to go inside this folder so I'll just write CD CD means change directory I want to go inside end to end medical chatboard gen by this folder okay now if I now if I hit enter you will see that I'm inside this particular folder right now now I'm inside this folder now inside this folder I'm going to open up my vs code so let's open up my vs code so this is my vs code guys okay H now let me Zoom now the first thing guys what I have to do I have to create uh one virtual environment here because I already told you if you are creating any kinds of end to end project first of all create a virtual environment then you have to set up all the requirements you need here so here let me add all the step you need to perform so here I have added all the stem in the readme file uh first of all you have to clone the repository if you're using my repository first of all clone it then try to create the environment with this command so make sure you using python 3.10 okay so I'll copy the command you can give any name I have given llm app you can give any name here fine so what I can do I can I think use medical medot okay I can use medibot you can use any name now let's create the environment so guys as you can see my environment is created now let's activate for this you have to execute this command all the command I have shared in the rme file just try to copy paste and I will also push this code in my GitHub so that you can see the changes now see medical bot has been activated fine now the next thing we'll be creating one file called requirement. txt file and inside that I'll be mentioning all the requirements I need and we'll be installing all the requirements here so guys here are the requirement list so these are the requirements actually I need to implement this uh project we'll be using sentence Transformer because here we'll be using open source embedding model to generate the vector embedding so that's why we'll be using sentence Transformer and sentence Transformer uses actually Transformer library that means it will use hugging fist platform hugging fist H to download that model open source model and with the help of that model actually we can generate the vector embedding and here I'm installing one specific version you can also install the latest version but this is the stable version I'm installing so far then Lang chain I think you know Lang chain then flask we need for the user interface then P PDF here we'll be using PDF document that's why then python. ENB why because here we'll be managing one EnV file okay file so inside EnV file be mentioning our openi credential as well as the we'll be also mentioning our Pine con credential because Pine con you also need to use one API key to authenticate with your account fine then you can see I'm installing Pine con and if you want to install Pine con you need to install this to library Pine con gr PC okay then you you need to also install Lenore Pine con then langin community langen openi and langen experimental okay so these are the dependency package you also need to install so let me install all of them I'll just try to save I'll open up my uh readme file I'll copy the command and here I can execute now see it will install all the package one by one so it may take some time guys let's wait once installation is completed I will come back so guys as you can see my installation is completed there is no error that means congratulation you have installed successfully everything now let me minimize the screen and now let me save everything yeah now see whenever you are implementing any kinds of end to end projects the first thing you have to create the project okay project folder structure struct structure okay this is very much important guys that means you have to create the entire project folder structure like in which folder in which file you have to write which function okay that's how you have to create the entire project folder structure and again this is your uh actually let's say design pipeline okay it's not like that you have to follow my pipeline always you have to follow my project folder structure always if you feel like okay this folder structure is good for you you can use it just try to design with respect to your project requirement with respect to your let's say uh I mean Choice okay no need to follow my one but if you want to follow my one you can also follow I usually prefer one project folder structure okay so I'll be showing you how we can implement this particular project folder structure that means automatically we will be creating the project folder structure here so here we'll be uh creating one file so the file name is template template. Pi okay this is going to be a python file so this will create the entire project template for me so here only I need to give my one time effort that means I'll be writing the entire logic to create the structure going forward whenever you want to create any kinds of product folder structure you can execute this file it will automatically create otherwise what will happen you have to manually create it let's say you want to create a folder you will be clicking here you'll give the folder name let's say test okay then I want to create another file inside folder again you will be opening this folder inside that you'll be creating another file let's say test.py okay so this is like very time-taking task let's say you want to create 100 of folders 100 of files this just try to consider how much time it will take even you have to manually check everything whether this file is present inside this folder or not so it's not a efficient way to create the folder structure okay you can create it but I won't be suggesting you because it will take lots of time so what you can do you can create one template file and a template file you can write one very python basic code and this code will automatically create the project folder structure for me let me show you how we can create it so for this I'm going to use some packet I'll be using operating system package then I also need something called path leap okay so let me import so from it is a available path leave input okay path I need the path why I need the path I'll tell you later on as of now let me import all of them then I also need something called login okay so login is inbuilt package inside python so here I will also log the information in my terminal fine so first of all you have to create an loging string okay so basic loging configuration you have to create so that's how you can create a basic loging configuration see okay this is the basic login configuration so here you have to write login basic config inside that you have to mention the log level first of all so here I need to create a information level log and this is the format of my log that means first of all it will save the uh asky time that means the current in uh time stamp like let's say whenever you are executing your code it will save that time stamp that means the time date so it will save everything then after that it will also save the log message like like which message you want to show okay it will also save that so whenever I'll execute the code you will get it okay what I have written here as of now just try to consider you have to mention this logging string here fine okay now you you have to give a list of the file you want to create so let's say left hand side I want to create some list of the folders and file so for this I have created a python list you can see so the name of the list is list of the files inside that I've mentioned I want to create a folder you can see folder name is SRC okay so it will create a folder here called SRC inside SRC I want to create a file called init.py that means underscore inore dop and this is nothing but my Constructor file if you already familiar with OP concept I think you know what is Constructor so Constructor is nothing but it's a special method it's a let's say the magic function it can execute automatically inside op but you can also create this is uh this actually Constructor as a python file okay so if you open up any kinds of end project now let me show you so if you go to any kinds of end repository let's say if I open tensorflow tensorflow uh GitHub it's a open source project so I can also see that their code implementation see they have also uh follow the modular approach see if I open any kinds of folder let's say if I open Java folder or let's say python folder now if you just go below you'll see this Constructor file is present here okay why because they have created so many folders you can see so many folders so many folders and inside that they have created different different python file so this folder would be considered as the local package that means they can also import some functionality from this folder let's say I want to import uh let's say this one this particular function let's say this function input a graph dep what I need to do I need to write so what I have to write I have to write from tenser FL do python okay then dot this file and import I want to this uh I want to import this function okay that's how I need to import this file that means instead of writing like all the function in just one file what I'm doing I'm creating a different different folder okay different different let's say component inside that I'm keeping those functionality okay and whenever I need it I'll be using it later on inside my endpoint okay this is called actually modular approach and to uh when whenever you are uh like following this modular approach whenever you are creating this kinds of folder to keep your function in a file make sure you are creating this Constructor file because this folder would be considered as your local package okay because later on you have to import it let's say from tensorflow do python import this function so whenever you will be importing uh make sure your python interpreter will consider this is my local environment okay that's that means I can import something from that folder this is the idea okay so that's why we are creating this Constructor file because SRC is my folder inside that I'll be creating one file called helper. piy okay and helper. Pi inside helper. Pi I'll be writing all the functionality let's say I want to inest the data I want to let's say extract the information I want to download the hugging face model all the functionality I'll be writing inside helper. Pi okay this is the idea now apart from helper. PI I need another file so inside SRC I'll be creating another file called prompt okay prompt. Pi inside that I'm I'm going to write the prompt okay prompt whatever prompt actually I need The Prompt let's say whatever system prompt I'll be using inside that I can write it here now I want to create a EnV file then I want to create a requirement. txt file oh sorry requirement is already created I can remove it as of now I don't need it I want to get up setup. P file why setup. P file because I want to install these are the folder as my local package for this I need setup.py okay previously I think I already explained this part then app.py then I want to create a folder called research inside that I want to create a jupyter notebook file that means trials. i1b so inside that first of all we'll be doing the jupit notebook experiment that means the entire project we'll be implementing through jupit notebook then we'll try to convert everything as our modular coding okay this is the idea so this is my list of the files and folder I need now I have written a simple python logic let me show you guys it's not a very fancy code it's a simple python code I have written so this code it will Loop through this list one by one that means it will Loop through this list one by one see I'm looping through the list it will give you the file path the entire file path then you giving this path to the path function why you are giving to the path function because see here we're using Windows machine and windows by default use backward slash I think you know see if I if I click here see windows by default use backward slash but which slash actually we using here we are using forward slash okay but in Linux Mac actually uh they will be using uh this forward slash but in Windows you have to use backward slash so that's why to uh I overcame this issue we we are using path uh actually path library from path Le see how it will work so let me show you one example so first of all I will open up my python okay now here let me first of all UT so from path Le okay import path okay then let's define a path here so I'll just write p is equal to test let's say slash uh T do PI okay let's say this is my uh folder inside that I'm having one file now what I will do okay it has given me one error let me see the okay so test is not defined that means I need to give inside double quotation because it's a path now so it should be a string type data now fine okay now if I give this P to my path uh function now see what will happen it will automatically detect my operating system based on that it will convert that part see it has given me Windows path it has automatically detected my operating system based on that it will convert this path to the windows path let's say you are using Linux you are using Mac automatically this path would be converted to that operating system okay so that's why instead of manually giving that path as a backward slash what I can do I can give to the path function path will automatically take care that means we can execute this project in any kinds of operating system okay otherwise uh in some of the operating system you will might get some issue okay that's why we have to always handle these kinds of scenario got it so whenever you are designing your software make sure you are handling the these kinds of scenario and you are making your application more robust that means in production it won't be failing whenever it is failing in the production this is not a robust application always you need to take care then after that what I'm doing I'm just splitting my folder name as well as the file name with the help of this actually function so inside operating system paath doit so what path. spit will do it will split your folder name and your file name that means inside this f file directory it will uh give the folder name inside the file name it will give the file name only Okay so you can also execute and test so let me show you so let's say this is my path now so this is my folder and this is my file now if I use first of all let me import operating system so if I give W do path dolit okay inside that I'll will give the P now see if I hit enter it will give me one tle see so in the first item it should be my folder and the second item it should be my file okay and this is what actually I'm storing inside two variable okay two variable I'm doing the couple unpacking here okay I hope is clear then first of all I have to create the folder okay I have to create the folder and to create the folder I'm using w. make directories so first of all I'm checking whether this file directory it is empty or not if it is not empty that means definitely I have some file folder name here so I'm creating the folder you can see then I'm performing the login operation I'm just doing the login in my terminal I'm telling creating a directory file directory from the for the file of file name okay this is the log message actually I'm printing in my terminal then after that I'm also creating the file that means folder creation is done then inside the folder I also need to create the file for this I have written this code actually first of all I have to check whether this file path is exist or not if it is not exist that means if it is not created I have to create it otherwise it is already created no I don't need to create it and I also check the size of the file path that means the file it is zero or not let's see if it is not zero that means inside that file I have written some code so I don't need to delete that file again let's say you want to create again it won't be replacing that file instead of that it will skip that file so that's why also checking the size if size is empty I'm creating this file you can see and I'm doing the long information otherwise I'm telling this file is already exist okay so this is the simple python code I have written now see the power of this script okay see the magic now left hand side see there is nothing there is no folder structure no file now if I execute this script now see what will happen I'll clear I'll simply execute this template. Pi file see template. Pi uh see automatically it will create the folder structure for me got it so it's just a one time effort guys you have to like write this code only one time and later on you can use it uh every time let's say you want to create another project copy this file right execute it will automatically create a folder structure for you let's say in future I need some more more actually let's say uh folder or let a file that's I need another file called test.py I'll just add it here make sure you are giving inside a string okay and you are giving a comma here because it's a list okay now see I'll execute it again it will automatically create that form see test. Pi is also created that's how you can add as much as file and folder you need okay it will automatically create you don't need to manually create it here okay this is the Advan to use this template. Pi file guys okay I hope it is clear now you can check it out since resource this trial do i1b file is created now inside SRC init created helper created prom created okay you can see init created helper created prom created ENB also created app created setup. Pi is created okay everything has created so now let's set up our project as my local package Okay so so for this I'll be writing the setup. pi code and this is a simple code guys I think previously I also shared so this is the setup.py code first of all give the project name that means the package name you want to give let's say tvi project because if I show you currently in my terminal uh inside my environment this uh package is not present so I'll just write P list see genv project is not there okay so I have to install as a genbi project okay for this we'll be using the setup. pi now give the version author name email okay and find package will try to find this uncore init.py and whenever this init.py is present it will consider this folder as my local package okay let me show you now to install this one you need to give one command inside requirement. file called hypen e space dot okay hypen is space this is the command now let me save now let me again install the requirements now see automatically it will install as my local package now see one a info file would be created here and whenever this EG info file is created that means this uh project has been set up as my local package let me show you now if I again do the P list operation now see Genera VI should be there see gener project is there now it is my local package okay that means now I can import anything from this SRC itself got it so this is the entire idea now let's commit the code in my GitHub guys so for this I'm going to open up my G bash and here I'm going to write one command called G add then G commit typen M now let's give one comit message let's say folder structure added then let's do the push operation so get push origin main okay now it has pushed now if I want to check let's go back our GitHub now let's refresh now see it is pushed in my GitHub and readme is also updated now you can copy all the command and you can execute in your system okay I hope it is clear great now the first thing we'll be doing the notebook experiment okay first of all we'll be implementing the entire project in our jupyter notebook then we'll be converting as our modular coding and after implementing jupyter notebook only you just need to copy paste operation okay that's it now first of all let me select the Kel so I already created one environment called medbot okay so let's select it h now Let's test whether this working or not so I'll give one print statement let's a print okay so this notebook should work now it is telling just try to install some IP 1B cardal package so let me install because I'm using jupyter notebook inside my vs code for this you need some additional package and it will automatically install for you so it will take some time after that you will see that execution would be completed so let's wait okay guys so as you can see execution is completed and it is giving me okay message okay it's fine now one thing I just wanted to show you let's say if I show you my project working directory right now let's say PWD so I'm inside this resarch folder okay inside resarch folder but I want to load my data and that my data would be present inside my data folder let's say I'll create a folder called Data okay inside that I'm going to move the PDF I'm having let me move quickly so guys as you can see inside data folder I'm having the PDF okay PDF document now see whenever you are implementing any project make sure you are working in the project directory okay that means your root project directory so this is my root project directory but currently I'm inside this resarch for but if I want to go get back okay inside my project working directory so what I have to do I have to execute one Moree command so let me import operating system package inside operating system you are having something called change directory okay let me show you so OS do CHD that mean change directory to hire one folder back so for this you can write do dot slash okay do do slash means so do do slash means it will get back one folder back okay let me show you now if I execute now if I again show you the PWD project working directory now now see I'm inside my root project folder itself okay so that's how actually you can check the folder location first of all okay otherwise what will happen you will get like path issue sometimes you'll get there's a data not found and so on okay so that to prevent this issue actually make sure you are working in the project folder directory always okay this is the Su I want to give you so first of all let's import some of the library here so here I'm importing uh langin from langin actually I'm importing P PDF loader and directory loader because I told you I will be using PDF documents and to load the PDF documents I need this P PDF loader it is present inside a directory okay that's why I have given directory loader then I also need to perform chunking operation and to perform the sing operation I can use recursive character text splitter okay I think you already familiar with these are the thing now let me import all of them now here to load the PDF here I have written a function let me show you so this is the function I have written guys okay extract the data from the PDF itself so the function name is load PDF it will take the actually data directory okay data directory and it will only load the PDF documents okay it will only load the PDF document let's say you want to load the docs document txt document at that time you can give the extension here fine so with of P PDF loader it will extract the information from the PDF itself okay and whatever uh let information it will extract it will give give me as a documents okay you can see now let me show you let me execute so it will return me extracted data so here I've given the path okay so it should be data okay data directory now let me show you so if I execute now see it is extracting all the information from the PDF of itself and it is having almost 700 actually pages so it will take some time so let's wait so guys as you can see my extraction is done now if I show you the extracted data see this is the entire extracted data actually you got okay from all the pages it will show you the data now let me comment it as of now H now what I have to do I have to uh perform the chunking operation because you remember see the architecture I have extracted the documents now I have to perform the chunking operation okay and to perform the chunking operation I will be using recursive text splitter so with that I have created another function here so split the data into text chunks so it will take the extracted data it will perform the chunking operation you can see so here is the code so chunk size is 5 500 and chunk over leave is 20 I have given and it will perform the chunking operation and it will give you the chunk results okay now let me show you so now if I execute the function and if I show you the length of the text chunks now see you got 7,000 20 chunks here guys 7,20 chunks you got just try to see how much data actually you have in the PDF okay and this is enough information to create one medical chat bot I believe that fine that's why I taken this big data guys now see this is the inter chance actually I got now what I have to do I have to use one embedding model to like perform the vector embedding and this embedding I'll be storing to the knowledge base that means inside my Pine con Vector database okay so now let's download one embedding model mod from the hugging face okay so here is the function I have written guys download hugging face embedding model now for this I need to import this package first of all let me import so this is the package guys hugging face embedding I'm importing from the Lang chain embedding okay now let me execute H now this function will automatically download one embedding model see this is the embedding model I want to use let me show you this embedding model so this is present inside hugging phase so the name of the model is all mini LM L6 V2 so this is one actually embedding model and it will give you Vector dimensional 3804 Dimension four dimensional Vector actually it will return you and this Dimension you need because whenever you are using pine con Vector database you need to also mention the dimension of the vector like like what is your vector Dimension whenever you are creating the clust now whenever you are creating the index that time you have to mention this Dimension so that's why always try to remember whenever you are using pine con Vector database try to see what kinds of let's say embedding model you are using and that embedding model uh Returns what kinds of dimensional Vector just try to see the documentation you will al already get it fine now let me download the embedding model so let me execute this function I'll download the embeding model see it is downloading from the hugging pH Hub so it will take some time let's wait so guys you can see my model has downloaded okay now let's test the model whether it is able to convert my sentence to Vector embedding or not so for this I've given one sentence here hello world and there is a function called embed query so it will automatically give you the vector embedding and I'm also checking the length whether it is giving me 384 dimensional vector or not now see if I execute the program now see length is 384 and if you want to see the vector see this is the complete Vector actually you got okay I hope it is clear now let me comment this line as of now got it now what I have to do guys I have to initialize my pine cone uh inside pine cone actually I have to store these are the vector okay the complete Vector actually I'll be generating from my Tex chunks so for this let's open up my pine cone so if you want to open up the pine con just write P con. so this is the website and make sure you created One account guys just do the sign up operation with your email address you can create an account so for me I already have one account let me login so guys as you can see this is my Pine con uh website okay this is the interface of the pine con and this is one of the amazing Vector database provider guys you will be loving a lot even I personally like it so here what I have to do guys I have to create a index that means I have to create a cluster in that cluster actually I'll be saving all of my Vector they have also given the quick uh start like how can set up the pine cone how we can let's say store the data see all the code example they have also given okay so we'll be following the same approach to store our embeddings to the Pine con but before that you have to collect one API key so how to collect the API key left hand side you can see one API key option is there just try to click here for me I already created one API key if you don't have just try to create API key just give the name let's say I'll give test or you can give any name let's create the API key okay so this is the API key now just try to copy the API key guys and try to mention inside this this EnV file so I'll open the EnV file so let me paste it here and make sure you are giving one key name here that means this is your Pine con API key okay that's it and make sure you are writing this thing in a stream got it h now let me open up my trials. IP andb now what I will do I'll just create a cluster here so let me go back to the database and don't share this key with anyone guys otherwise they will be also able to access your account okay I'll REM it after this recording so for you don't need to share with anyone now inside pine cone either you can manually create the index let's say you can click here create index let's create one index let's say I want to create uh let say anything you can give test now Dimension let's say 300 and 84 the same Dimension I will give here the dimension actually I'm getting cosine Matrix just keep it you can also select different different Matrix like what kinds of let's say similarity Matrix it will apply whenever it will do the semantic SS operation I want to use cosine score now now just keep it everything as default you don't need to change the provider see AWS is the free one if you let's say sign up for the first time you can create one to two cluster here with the help of AWS cloud provider but if you want to take this premium subscription that means if you want to create a multiple cluster if want to take some more space you can see see if you're using free plan you will get 2 GB storage here but if you have more than 2 GB data that time you have to take the premium subscription okay that time actually what you have to do you have to take their plan subscription plan let's see if I take this one one uh Google Cloud now see see the price plan see this is the price plan actually they have so with respect to that you can also purchase there uh let's say machine okay but as of now I'll be using the free free services only I don't need the let's say premium subscription of the pine con but if you are creating the actual project if you need more spaces that time you can do it so I'll be selecting the AWS cloud provider and Reon just keep it everything as default only just need to give the name okay name and a dimension that's it 384 okay now let's create the index so this is the manual approach to create the index guys okay this is the manual approach see this index is getting created it is getting initialized and once it is initialized see it will be connected okay see it is now connected okay now if you want to connect it you can execute this python code and you can insert your data all the conf code they have already given okay but I don't want to create this index manually I want to create through the python code so let me delete it so if you want to delete you just click here and try to delete the index so you have to give the name okay I'll beting because I will be creating through the python code and how to like create through the python code guys I think they have already given one stter code remember so here you can give the uh index name like which index you want to create and create index Dimension you can give here Matrix serverless AWS region okay everything you can pass here so now let's use this approach to create the index so what I'll do I'll go back to my vs code and I already prepared this code for you so let me show you so this is the code only you just need to change the API key so let me change the API key the API key I have collected here let me copy and let me change it here or I think I can read it from the environment only so what I can do I can import the environment just a minute so let's import so from EnV import load EnV okay then I will load the EnV now simply I'll get this Pine con API key from my environment and here it will save inside this variable now this variable actually I'll pass here okay so no body won't be able to see my API key that time so this is the best approach guys you can also follow now you can give the index name let's say I'll give medical bot medical bot let's say this is my index name and here you have to give the dimension so make sure which uh actually U embedding model you're using and what is the dimension size 384 that means it's fine 384 keep everything as default cosine s a US one okay no need to change anything because we are using free cluster here fine now once you will execute this code okay once you will execute this code you will see that uh your U index would be automatically created in the pine con let me show you so if I see if I execute discorde now see what will happen so guys execution is done now if I get back to my Pine con and if I refresh it here see medical chatboard should be created here let me show you see medical chatbot is created automatically it has created and now it is active and running okay now what I can do I can uh convert our uh let's say chunks to the vector embedding and I can store inside the pon Vector database so for this uh what I can do so for this first of all set this pine cone uh API key as as your environment variable because uh whenever we'll be storing the let's say data to the Pine con so Pine con internally looks for this API key inside the environment variable okay so for this we are using operating system Environ okay Environ and this is the key name guys I've giving and I'm setting my Pine con API key okay whatever API key I'm loading from my EnV file so it will set inside my envirment variable right now okay so whenever I'll execute my Pine con code I don't need to like again and again pass it okay again and again I don't need to pass it here this is the advantage now see to store the vector embedding this is the code snippit you have to execute guys so you can see this is the Cod snipp it let me comment here now I'm importing Lin Pine con import Pine con vectory store okay now inside Pine con vectory store you have one function called from documents so first of all you have to give the documents that means my text chunks the text chunks I have created remember so this is the text chunks I have created okay so this text chunks you have to give then you have to give the index name so what is the index name I have given guys I think remember this is the index name that means this index name it is already created that means inside this index it will store the data got it so make sure you check this other the variable now I need to give the embedding model so I think remember we downloaded one embedding model OKAY from the hugging fa got it so this three parameter you have to pass here now see if I execute this line if I execute this line it will convert all of my data to the vector embedding and will restore to the uh Pine con Vector database and how many chunks I got guys I think remember I got 7,20 chunks that means 7,20 chunks Vector will be restored inside my pine cone so it will take some time guys let's wait after execution after executing this code I'll pause the video and once this Vector will get store in my Pine con I will come back again see let me show you if I go to my Pine con right now and if you refresh the page here see all of the vector would be stored here even you can also see the count let me show you see as of now 864 let's say chunks has been added now see th000 now see you can also see the visualization of the vector it's amazing right so whenever you used to use local vector it was not possible to visualize our Vector but here it is possible you can see you can also see the score that means um centic score like what is the score between this Vector this vector and this Vector got it this is one amazing visualization guys you will get in the pine cone and see this is the entire Vector representation of this entire sentence okay entire text okay and even it is also showing the page page number with in which page it is extracting the data and what is the PDF name as well okay every information you can see here even you can also perform the qud operation that means the way you perform the SQL qu you can also perform the qu operation here manually everything is possible but everything we'll be doing through the python code I'm not going to use the manual approach here now see the vector count guys so 4, 120 Vector has been stored now let's wait uh once it has saved all my all of my Vector dor I'll come back and I'll show you so guys as you can see my execution is completed now if I get back to my pine cone and if I refresh see all of the vector it has stored here like more than 7,000 Vector it has stored inside my Pine con index okay now what I can do I can use this uh index as my knowledge base that means we'll be connecting my large language model with this knowledge base and we'll be asking the query and it will do the semantic search operation here okay this is the idea now let's get back to my code editor now see I already created the index and I already stored my Vector there now I want to load my existing okay existing index if you want to load the index existing index what you can do you can use this code cipit okay see again I'm importing Pine con Vector from Lang and pine con and there is another function called from existing index okay from existing index you have to give the index name so the index name I've given the same index name and you have to pass the embedding model the embedding model you have downloaded now see if you execute this line of code it will load the index that means whatever index you have created and all the vector actually it will load and it will give you the doc Source doc Source object okay this is an object doc Source object now you can also perform the retrieve operation here that me you can perform the similarity Source operation here let me show you one example there's a doc as rever sear type similarity search keyword three that means it will give you three relevant answer let me show you so if I initialize my R object and now I will ask one question here so this is my medical data I will ask let's say what is acne okay acne so I think you know inside this PDF I'm having acne related dis dis also let me show you so if I press contrl F acne so guys as you can see this is the acne disease what is acne and all so you can see acne and acne related actually treatment okay medicine they have suggested each and everything so I asking one question here so what is acne it should give me the relevant uh answer okay for the acne from my knowledge base now let me execute and let me show you now see if I show you this Rel uh rate docs it will give you three results actually three results even it is also showing the source okay from where it is it has referred now see different different actually uh acne related response it has given me okay because I have set SAR keyword is equal to three it will only give me three response okay but I don't need these kinds of output I need a complete let's say definition okay what is act name got it so for this what I have to do guys I I think you remember I have to integrate my large language model that means here we'll be working on user will give the query this query will go to knowledge Bas knowledge will give the rank results I'll be using the large language model so LM will process this rank result as well as the query and it will give me the correct response okay so for this let's initialize my model so I already told you we'll be using open model so open so let's initialize my model and I think you already know what is temperature and Max token so it is giving you one error okay it is giving me error because I haven't set my open API key so let's set the open API key I'll open up my environment so here is my API key guys so make sure you create one API key and just try to paste here and similar wise I also need to set this API key as in my environment variable okay so let me execute this code mm so here what I can do I can duplicate this line and here I can write open API key so it will also give me my open a key then here whenever I'm setting as an environment here I can also change open a key open I key okay now let's set this one okay string expected non time why okay so I think I have to load it every uh again then I have to execute now it should work now it is working fine now if I get back here now if I initialize it it should work see successfully have initialized my large language model now I have to create the complete chain for this let's import some Library previously I showed you now how to create the rag application there I think you remember we were importing this uh Library create T chain create stop document chain okay create promp chat promp template okay everything I already showed you there so we are importing the same code here now this is going to be my system prompt so here I want to give this prompt in my language model OKAY large language model now I'm going to create the complete prompt prompt template you can see this is the system pront and whatever input user will give that means the input actually I have given it will come here and it will give you the complete output now let me initialize now let's create my chain so create a stop chain inside that you have to give the llm as well as the prompt and whatever object you will get in inside create retal CH you have to pass it as well as the ret that means your vector isore the vector hisory you created okay object now let's initialize my chain now let's ask the question so here I will give what is acne okay what is acne sorry acne now see see the response guys see acne is a common skin disease characterized by pulse on the face chest and back it is caused by uh clogged force and become inflamed due to the oil dead skin cells okay and bacteria treatment uh and so on see that means it has given me the correct response if you open the PDF now this book right now and if you read it here you'll see that it it has given me the correct response now see if I giving any other question which is not relevant about the PDF what will happen see now see if I give any other let's say question let's say I have given what is stats that means what is statistics it is telling me I don't know because here I have given the now so if you if you're not getting the context that means here this question I'm asking this is out of context that means the data I have given to my model OKAY the knowledge Bas I have given uh to my model so this information is not available here so that's why it is telling I don't know okay so this is the complete custom uh actually system we have created like custom chatbot we have created which is only referring our custom data okay I hope it is clear so guys this is actually entire demo like that's how actually be implementing the entire application now you can ask any kinds of question let me show you so you can take any other disase let me show you or let's take any other disase okay let's take this dise actually this one I'll copy and I'll come back here then I'll ask here now let's see see uh it is giving you the response growth hormones resulting the abnormal growth okay see that means this is the correct response actually I'm getting now if you see the image so the same thing okay so you can see um this disase is a abnormal releases particular chemical from the blah blah blah okay so you can read it so that means we are getting the correct response fine now let's try to convert this project as our end to end uh implementation right now that means we'll be also implementing the UI but before that I have to first of all create the modular coding okay so what I'll do guys I will first of all open up my help .p inside H.P whatever let's say uh utility code I have written let's say loading the data then U creating the chunks then loading the embedding model all the function I will move inside this ala. Pi so let me open so inside that I'm going to import all of the library see I just copy pasted the code from my notebook only if you open the notebook the same code actually I'm composting and why is giving the error because below you can see I have to select my environment the correct environment let's say medical bot now this error will be disappeared now see all the function I'll just copy paste here all the three function I have written now my load PDF then uh this one text split and this one my load embedding model so here I kept all the function you can see because I want to UT from here so these are the function I don't want to create inside my endpoint otherwise my code base would be like messy right that's why I am creating inside this particular file now let me save and inside prompt actually what I will do I'll give the system prompt whatever prompt actually have written so here is the prompt guys I think you remember I'll copy The Prompt and inside prompt. Pi I'm going to mention it here okay so from here I'm going to open the prompt let's see in future us uh you want to change the prompt you want to give any other prompt you can open this prompt. P you can change here it will reflect in your code okay no need to open your actual code implementation that time and so let me close this at the tab as of now it's not required now yeah so helper is fine now what I will do I will create another file here and I will name it as store _ index uhp okay P why because let's say you want to update this book let's say you want to add some more information that time again you have to store all the embeddings to the knowledge base that means inside your Pine con yes or no right and to store it I again need to execute one like end point that means stoore index. Pi whenever you will execute it it will load the new information and it will store to the vector database again fine so for this what I will do I'll prepare this one so see whatever code I have written now here that means I extracted my U let's say documents I created the chunks downloaded theing model after that I pushed everything to my Vector database okay see all the let's Vector database code I have written everything I need to write inside Daton so let me import all of the library so you can see I'm importing from SRC help part that means from SRC help part so inside helper I'm having three function load PDF then text split and download Face embeddings okay see I'm importing all of them hugging for embeding okay then I'm also importing Pine con then Pine con Vector store then load ENB and operating system first of all I have to set my environment variable that means my credential okay open sorry Pine con API credential then I'll be loading my data extracting the data creating the chunks then I'll be loading the m bding model see load file that means I'm loading the data so I have to give the data location so this is my data location then Tex pter will run then download the embeding mod okay then after that I will initialize my pine cone code base the same code guys if you open the Jupiter notebook file the same code see Pine con initialization it will create the medical chat board okay Medical Board that means this bot it will create okay then uh it will actually uh create the index then it will store the embeddings okay so at the very first time you have to execute this line guys okay very first time you have to execute this file then uh whatever actually let's say data you are having it will uh do the vector conversion that means aing conversion then it will store to the vector database okay now what I'll do I'll just delete my previous embeddings whatever I created uh this uh cluster I I want to delete it because I now I'm doing the modular coding now so I'll be executing everything from my modular coding itself now let me remove it it now see it will delete it after sometimes you'll see that it won't be visible here now see make sure guys before launching your application first of all you need to execute this store index. Pi make sure this index should be created otherwise you won't be able to do the query operation right so at the very first time you have to execute this store index. Pi okay then you will be launching your application that means app.py and this this one you have to only execute one time not multiple time multi time when you will be executing whenever you will update the data let's say you want to add any other data one more PDF that time you'll be executing this file okay otherwise just keep it as default that's it now let me save now I think this is deleted now see there is nothing now what I'll do uh let me show you how it will create everything so I'll open up my terminal let me clear now let's execute this store index. Pi python store index. by now let's execute see it will perform all the operation whatever things we have done in the jupyter notebook so let's wait after sometimes you'll see that your uh index would be created and inside index all the vector would be stored so guys as you can see my uh index is created now if I open it up inside that uh now it will store the embeddings one by one all the embeddings it will sa so guys as you can see my execution is completed and it's it has stored all of my Vector now that means my uh this store index is working fine I'm successfully able to store my Vector now let's create the endpoint okay that means my um I mean main application so user will uh uh start this application right now so here I already told you we will be using flask okay so here I already told you we'll be using flask here and if I'm using flask I need a HTML and CSS code to create the um one beautiful user interface so I already created one HTML and CSS code for you guys if you don't know it's completely fine again I'm telling you there are so many template you will get over the Internet there is a website called bootstrap previously I also told you I think bootstrap okay bootstrap website so from here you will get different different example even you can also see different different template it is having even if you search like chatbot HTML CSS free template free template you will get different different actually template see different different template you can also download The Source course even see code is also visible you can also download even you will get some website see different different chat template okay different different chat template you can use it okay it's up to you now what I will do I'll uh quickly just show you the HTML CSS code I have prepared for this I think you know if you're using flask you need to create one folder here called template okay templates so inside that you have to create a file call index. HTM okay now let me show you my HTML code I have prepared or it's a chat bot what I can do I can name it as chat. HTML okay chat. HTML now this is the entire HTML code guys I prepared okay save it now I need to create another folder for the CSS called startic so these are the requirement folder for the um flask if you're using flask inside python you need to create this the folder inside startic I'll be creating a file call style. CSS okay now let me also paste the CSS code I copied from the internet okay so this is one basic template I created now whenever I will uh show you my application you will see the user interface whatever the user interface I created now let me create my endpoint app.py now inside app.py I'll be integrating all of the functionality I have prepared so far so first of all let me all the requirement package all the required package actually one by one so so here I'm using flask so I have imported flask from the flask I imported all the required functionality you can see then imported uh download hugging face embedding model okay because I need the embedding object to load my Vector restore I think you know that I need to load this not this actually pine cone index now so where is the pine code index so here is the pine Cod index so I need to load this index and to load this index what I need I need the let's say this one embedding object I think remember at the last I showed you loading exist index okay I think you need it okay I think you remember fine so that is why I have to uh import it then I'm importing you can see Pine code store openi rable keyway that means whatever let's say I was loading here here these are the thing I'm loading everything fine then I also need to load my prompt so prompt is available inside my prompt. Pi here so I I can UT it so simply I can inut just write prompt SRC do prompt import that means I want to start everything inside that file okay that's it then I also need something called operating system so import voice that's it now let me initialize my flask to initialize the flask you have to use this code go to the flask documentation you will get it now let's set all of my openi and pine environment okay for this I need to use the clading environment package that's it then I will be downloading the embedding model then I will uh first of all initialize my embedding object then I will load my existing uh index from my Pine phone so let me show you see the same code from The Notebook I copied see so I'm loading the existing index Medical Board make sure name is correct Medical Board yeah it's correct then it will give me the retriever object then I'm loading the open a model then creating the prom template then after that I'm creating the chain okay now now I have to create two route exactly first route would be my default route that means user will get the interface of my application chat. HTML would be rendered got it now second route I'll be doing for the chat operation that means user is giving any query to the chatbot so that message actually I'll be accepting and this message I will give to my llm okay that means you can see I'm doing the inbo operation okay so same inbo operation I'm performing let me show you so here is the inbo operation M okay in and whatever response I'm getting I'm printing it as well as I'm showing in in my uh that user interface okay that's it now let me execute my application so I'm running on my Local Host port number 80 de is equal to that means if you change anything it will automatically update everything so now let me show you my application so let's open up my terminal so I'll just execute python app.py sorry it should be python spelling is not okay python okay now it should be running now see just give the allow permission now see your application is running now let's open up our Google uh Google Chrome search for local host port number 8080 see guys this is the interface we have created and this is one amazing uh interface guys you can see amazing um chat template we have created uh because many people have requested me just try to create one front end part of our application as well beautiful front end part and that's how you can create a beautiful front end part now here you can ask any kind of question let's say I will ask the same question I'll ask what is acne the acne is a common uh skin disease by characteristic by pimples on the face fine then I will ask another question let's say I got fever what should I do see now this is the response if you are experiencing high fever it is important to seek the medical attention Okay so tell me some medicine now see it is also suggesting some medicine okay related fever now you can ask any kinds of question from the let's say PDF itself any kinds of disease you can ask let's say this is the disease I want to ask I'll just copy and here I'll just write what is this disas and all about see it has uh given me the response okay now you can read this uh I mean PDF and you can see that you can ask the medicine uh you can ask for the treatment anything you can ask so this is our chatbot guys this is our medical chatbot we have created and see it is also giving you the one beautiful user interface okay it is also returning now what we'll do we'll just try to also deploy this application guys but before that we'll be implementing some more endn projects then after that I'll uh keep one uh dedicated endn let's say deployment session there I'll will show you how we can deploy these are the project on the cloud platform okay so yes guys I hope you liked it but before that what I will do guys I will comment Des are the code in my GitHub so you can also comit from the vs code let's comit from here I light U updated let's comment and VMV file would be automatically ignored by the git ignore okay because inside git ignore you have already mentioned it do git ignore would be ignored see would be ignored okay so it w be published inside my GitHub now if I open up my GitHub now if I refresh see all the code has been updated now I can write the further Cod uh let's step as well in the read me file okay so I have added all the step like after that what you have to do uh after that you can uh set your uh uh environment key then run store index then app.py then you just need to local up open up your Local Host okay now let me comment the changes as well so read me updated and make sure guys you start this uh repository all of you start this repository you can also forkit so that you will have the reference okay now if I refresh now see read me is updated and you can see all the step I have also added that's how you can also prepare your read me file so that so that if other people is referring your let's say GitHub they will be also able to set up this code okay in their system as well fine so yes guys this is the complete implementation I hope you liked it so that's how we can create any kinds of n to gen VI B project fine and no need to worry I'll also show you the deployment even we will be also discussing about LM Ops uh with the help of LM Ops also will'll be learning how we can access any can open source D language model okay as a hosted open source lar language model we can use it so yes guys this is all about from this video if you liked it so please uh try to subscribe to to the Channel Try to like it and try to share it so thanks for watching and I will see you next time\n"

       "\"hello guys my name is B hammed and welcome to my course so guys in this video we'll be implementing one end to end genbi project called ENT medical chatbot so I think you already know what is medical chatbot let's say if you have any medical related query let's say you got one disease so you are asking for the diagnosis you are asking for the medicine so this bot will able to give the response with respect to that that means it will give you the suggestion it will give you the medicine suggestion it will give you the diagnosis suggestion so these kinds of information this bot will provide so we'll be creating the complete system here that means here first of all we'll be using our custom data the entire let's say medical information custom data we'll be using first of all we'll be teaching our model we'll be creating the entire knowledge base then I'm going to connect my large language model there that means whatever information you'll be asking related the medical let's say any kinds of disease any kinds of medicine any kinds of let's say diagnosis so everything your chatbot will be able to give you the response okay so this is the system we'll be implementing and this is not going to be guys uh like notebook implementation so here we'll be creating the complete pipeline that means we'll be creating the front end part of our application that means we'll be creating the beautiful user interface so that user can put the query and they can get the response from the chat bar fine and here we'll be using something called modular coding in Python so it's not like scripting programming we'll be writing we'll be using modular concept here to implement the entire project fine and also we'll be uh using the git and GitHub to let's say do the version controlling so uh that means we'll be following the entire development pipeline here what are the things things you need even I will also show you how we can deploy this project okay in a cloud platform so everything guys we'll be implementing in this project so make sure you're watching this video till the end and if you have any question you can feel free to ask me okay in the comment section so first of all what I will show you guys I will show you the entire project architecture like what are the things we are going to develop then I will also show you the tools and Technology we'll be using here then we'll start the implementation fine so let's open up our Blackboard and try to understand the project architecture so guys as I already told you we'll be using our custom data here okay we'll be using custom data custom Medical Data I can write medical data so let me show you I'm having one entire actually medical book so guys you can see this is the book the book name is the G Encyclopedia of medicine okay second edition so this is the book you can also search on Google you will get this book and it is having uh around 637 Pages it's like very uh big book and it is having all kinds of information regarding the medical so see if you open this book actually you will see all kinds of content let's say all kinds of disease even with respect to that disease what kinds of medicine actually you need what kinds of diagnosis technique you need everything this book has uh covered okay so it is having different different um different different treatment different different uh actually medicine different different disease even the disease image is also visible here all kinds of disease actually it is having all kinds of disease actually it is having even with respect to that they have also given the diagnosis even the treatment okay how let's say you can do the diagnosis how you can do the treatment what kinds of medicine you have to let's say take everything this book has uh given the information so here we'll be using this book actually the entire medical information and we'll be creating the knowledge base that means here we'll be using pine cone Vector database okay I think you know Pine con is a cloud-based Vector database that means there we can store the embedding Vector embedding that means first of all we'll be extracting all the information from this book then we'll be creating the chunks and that chunks actually with the help of embedding model we'll be creating the vector embedding and that Vector embedding will be storing to the pine cone Vector DB and that Pine con Vector DB is going to be my knowledge base that means the entire knowledge base H why I'm not using the local Vector database here because my data size is huge if you see 637 Pages information I'm having so if you just create the chunks just try to consider how many chunks you will get and if you're storing in the local DB it won't be efficient so that that's why we'll be using cloud-based Vector DV here fine and I'll will show you how we can use the pine cone properly it's one of the amazing Vector DV when I personally prefer so there actually you can also see your vector visualization okay everything you can see see this is another actually disease see this is the disease actually even with respect to that they have also given the diagnosis as well as the medicine now I'll share this PDF with you guys you can uh see The Complete Book if you want to see different different medicine and different different let's say diagnosis okay you can check it out so here what we'll be doing guys we'll be using this medic book so let's say this is one PDF documents actually I'm having or here I can write medical okay medical book so from the medical book what we'll do we'll just extract all the information extract all docks okay then after that we'll be creating different different chunks and I think you know what is chunking is required right because here we'll be using large language model and large language model is having input uh actually size one specific input size and we have to follow that input size I think previously we learn about llama llama is having 4,096 okay this is the input length uh that means this is the maximum input length it can take the data if you're using open a model Also let's say GPT okay GPT is also having one specific input lend if you want to see that just open the open.com and go to the model section you will see that GPT input l so whatever actually large language model you are using first of all try to see the input length Okay of that model like what would be the maximum token size based on that try try to perform the chunking operation okay that should be my suggestion now it will give me different different chunks so let's say I will get chunk one the chunk one we'll be getting Chun two we'll be getting chunk three and so on then after getting the chunks what I have to do guys I'll be using one embeding model embedding model okay with this embedding model we'll generate the vector embedding okay it will give me different different Vector embedding you'll be getting Vector embedding I can copy and I can paste it here so we'll be getting different different Vector embedding and with this Vector embedding guys what we'll do we'll just try to build one centic index that means the knowledge base right build centic index so this is going to be my knowledge base that means we'll be storing this Vector to the vector database so I can write knowledge base okay knowledge base and here we'll be using something called Pine con Vector store okay so let's me just write VOR DB okay DB VOR DB and guys uh this is going to be my complete backend comp component okay so here I can write this is going to be my backend component okay component now I have to work on the front end component that means user will uh give some query and with respect to the quy actually uh I have to uh give the proper response okay let's say this is the user this is the user so user will send one query let's say this is the query user has asked so first of all it will convert to the query embedding okay query embedding that means this is going to be a English text right and that should also converted to the vector embedding this Vector embedding will go to the knowledge base okay it will go to the knowledge base and knowledge base will return some rank results okay rank result or similar let's say result it will return return okay rank results then I'll be using one large language model so here we'll be using one large language model llm so here I'm going to use openi large language model you can use any kinds of large language model you can use open source large language model okay you can also use the Gin you can also use uh let's say Mistral anything you can use here so here I'm going to use open large language model because here I'm going to create a production ready application so this application will be also deploying in the cloud platform okay that's why uh I'll be using openi model okay why openi model because openi model is already hosted in the openi server we can access this model through API request but if I'm using any open source L language model we have to download this model in our local machine and local machine doesn't have like good configuration let's say instance let's say you don't have good configuration GPU you don't have good configuration actually Ram CPU that time actually you can't execute this model in your system okay it it will be very much difficult for you and you will see that inference time would be also very high that means uh this modu will keep processing the input it will take lots of time to give you the response so that's why we'll be using openi model and going forward I'll be discussing about llm Ops and there I'll tell you how we can also use like different different open source large language model let's say if I want to use Lama okay llama if I want to let's say use mistal Falcone okay cloudy any kinds of model if I want to use how I can use it even how we can use it use it as a efficient way even how we can deploy these are the model in the cloud platform so for this we'll be using something called llm ops okay llm Ops we'll be using that means we'll be using different different platform we'll be running about Bedrock okay AWS Bedrock we'll be learning about let's say gcp vertex AI vertex so these are the llm Ops platform okay so we'll be uh using this lmos platform to access these are the model and on top of that we'll be creating the application f so this is what actually we'll be explaining later on guys so first of all try to see how we can implement this production ready project with the help of open AI model and there is another uh reason actually we are using openi model because if I uh let's say if I'm using open source large language model you will see that open source large language model size would be very huge let's say around 10 GB 20 GB and this model you can't execute in your local uh machine that means your low configuration machine and if you're deploying this project to the cloud platform there you have to take good instance that means you have to take GPU based instance with higher Ram higher CPU higher GPU and just try to consider about the cost like how much how much cost actually it will take that cloud platform you can go to any kinds of cloud platform you can see their uh instance actually type if you're taking GPU based instance type with higher Ram higher let say CPU you'll see that per hour it will cost you like more amount of money okay so again you are increasing the cost here whenever you are using open source large language model okay without any kinds of LM Ops tool LM Ops platform you will get the difficulty for sh right so that's why we will be using here openi model although it will charge you but it will charge you less than uh the open source model actually you'll be hosting in future okay this is the idea here so now what will happen this rank results will go to the llm even this quy also will go to the llm and llm will process L will try to understand the query as well as the rank results whatever results actually your knowledge Bas is returning based on that it will give you the correct response okay correct response or you can talk about answer correct answer let's say you are asking one question let's say I got Fe what can I do so it will first of all refer the knowledge base it will try to find out the let's say fever diagnosis fever medicine then with respect to that it will give you the um response got it so this is the entire system actually will be implementing and this is what actually our front end so this is what actually our front end many people also ask me like sir uh just try to create some application with the help of good front end development as well so that's why I also kept this front end development here we'll be creating one beautiful user interface so that user can give the qu here I think you use the chat GPT chat GPT is having one beautiful user interface okay so you'll be also creating these kinds of chatbot kinds of interface so that user can give any kind of query and they can get the response fine so this is the entire architecture of our project guys okay I hope it is clear now now technology wise I already told you here we'll be using uh large language model openi OKAY openi llm will'll be using then here we'll be using Lang chin as a Genera framework to develop the entire project then here we'll be using Vector database wise Pine con okay Pine con is a cloud uh cloud-based Vector database okay so there actually you can create a um instance and you can store your vector and here to create the user interface we'll be using something called flask okay flask is a python framework you can create web application okay with that got it uh yeah so I hope these are the actually technology we'll be using as of now and if I need it anything I'll tell you okay later on now guys what I to do guys uh first of all let's create one uh yeah so let me also write we'll be also using GitHub okay GitHub to do the version controlling of our entire application fine and later on we'll be also deploying this project to the AWS Cloud okay AWS Cloud so we'll be learning about the simple deployment as well as the cicd deployment okay both will be learning so guys this is the entire agenda so now let's open up our GitHub and try to create one GitHub repository first of all with our project then we'll be starting with the implementation fine so I'll go to my GitHub guys so this is my GitHub you can also follow me here I have created lots of repository that might help you a lot so just go to the repository and here uh create one new repository and give the name let's to create a medical um I'll just write end to end okay medical chatbot Genera VI so this is my repo name you can give any repon name as for your requirement now I'll be keeping as a public repository because I want to uh share this code with you so everyone can see that I'll will add the readme file as well as I will add the dog ignore file so here I'll be using Python Programming I'll be selecting the python let's take the license you can take any license I'll be taking Amit license now everything is fine now let's create the repository okay now let's CL the repository I'll copy the link address make sure youve selected HTTP 1 Now open up your local folder so let me open up my local folder and here I'll open up my terminal you can open up your let's say G bash you can open up your anacon anything and just write the command get clone and press the link here so it will clone that repository in your local machine now see it has clone now let me go inside this folder you can see currently I'm inside Lang chain project okay now I want to go inside this folder so I'll just write CD CD means change directory I want to go inside end to end medical chatboard gen by this folder okay now if I now if I hit enter you will see that I'm inside this particular folder right now now I'm inside this folder now inside this folder I'm going to open up my vs code so let's open up my vs code so this is my vs code guys okay H now let me Zoom now the first thing guys what I have to do I have to create uh one virtual environment here because I already told you if you are creating any kinds of end to end project first of all create a virtual environment then you have to set up all the requirements you need here so here let me add all the step you need to perform so here I have added all the stem in the readme file uh first of all you have to clone the repository if you're using my repository first of all clone it then try to create the environment with this command so make sure you using python 3.10 okay so I'll copy the command you can give any name I have given llm app you can give any name here fine so what I can do I can I think use medical medot okay I can use medibot you can use any name now let's create the environment so guys as you can see my environment is created now let's activate for this you have to execute this command all the command I have shared in the rme file just try to copy paste and I will also push this code in my GitHub so that you can see the changes now see medical bot has been activated fine now the next thing we'll be creating one file called requirement. txt file and inside that I'll be mentioning all the requirements I need and we'll be installing all the requirements here so guys here are the requirement list so these are the requirements actually I need to implement this uh project we'll be using sentence Transformer because here we'll be using open source embedding model to generate the vector embedding so that's why we'll be using sentence Transformer and sentence Transformer uses actually Transformer library that means it will use hugging fist platform hugging fist H to download that model open source model and with the help of that model actually we can generate the vector embedding and here I'm installing one specific version you can also install the latest version but this is the stable version I'm installing so far then Lang chain I think you know Lang chain then flask we need for the user interface then P PDF here we'll be using PDF document that's why then python. ENB why because here we'll be managing one EnV file okay file so inside EnV file be mentioning our openi credential as well as the we'll be also mentioning our Pine con credential because Pine con you also need to use one API key to authenticate with your account fine then you can see I'm installing Pine con and if you want to install Pine con you need to install this to library Pine con gr PC okay then you you need to also install Lenore Pine con then langin community langen openi and langen experimental okay so these are the dependency package you also need to install so let me install all of them I'll just try to save I'll open up my uh readme file I'll copy the command and here I can execute now see it will install all the package one by one so it may take some time guys let's wait once installation is completed I will come back so guys as you can see my installation is completed there is no error that means congratulation you have installed successfully everything now let me minimize the screen and now let me save everything yeah now see whenever you are implementing any kinds of end to end projects the first thing you have to create the project okay project folder structure struct structure okay this is very much important guys that means you have to create the entire project folder structure like in which folder in which file you have to write which function okay that's how you have to create the entire project folder structure and again this is your uh actually let's say design pipeline okay it's not like that you have to follow my pipeline always you have to follow my project folder structure always if you feel like okay this folder structure is good for you you can use it just try to design with respect to your project requirement with respect to your let's say uh I mean Choice okay no need to follow my one but if you want to follow my one you can also follow I usually prefer one project folder structure okay so I'll be showing you how we can implement this particular project folder structure that means automatically we will be creating the project folder structure here so here we'll be uh creating one file so the file name is template template. Pi okay this is going to be a python file so this will create the entire project template for me so here only I need to give my one time effort that means I'll be writing the entire logic to create the structure going forward whenever you want to create any kinds of product folder structure you can execute this file it will automatically create otherwise what will happen you have to manually create it let's say you want to create a folder you will be clicking here you'll give the folder name let's say test okay then I want to create another file inside folder again you will be opening this folder inside that you'll be creating another file let's say test.py okay so this is like very time-taking task let's say you want to create 100 of folders 100 of files this just try to consider how much time it will take even you have to manually check everything whether this file is present inside this folder or not so it's not a efficient way to create the folder structure okay you can create it but I won't be suggesting you because it will take lots of time so what you can do you can create one template file and a template file you can write one very python basic code and this code will automatically create the project folder structure for me let me show you how we can create it so for this I'm going to use some packet I'll be using operating system package then I also need something called path leap okay so let me import so from it is a available path leave input okay path I need the path why I need the path I'll tell you later on as of now let me import all of them then I also need something called login okay so login is inbuilt package inside python so here I will also log the information in my terminal fine so first of all you have to create an loging string okay so basic loging configuration you have to create so that's how you can create a basic loging configuration see okay this is the basic login configuration so here you have to write login basic config inside that you have to mention the log level first of all so here I need to create a information level log and this is the format of my log that means first of all it will save the uh asky time that means the current in uh time stamp like let's say whenever you are executing your code it will save that time stamp that means the time date so it will save everything then after that it will also save the log message like like which message you want to show okay it will also save that so whenever I'll execute the code you will get it okay what I have written here as of now just try to consider you have to mention this logging string here fine okay now you you have to give a list of the file you want to create so let's say left hand side I want to create some list of the folders and file so for this I have created a python list you can see so the name of the list is list of the files inside that I've mentioned I want to create a folder you can see folder name is SRC okay so it will create a folder here called SRC inside SRC I want to create a file called init.py that means underscore inore dop and this is nothing but my Constructor file if you already familiar with OP concept I think you know what is Constructor so Constructor is nothing but it's a special method it's a let's say the magic function it can execute automatically inside op but you can also create this is uh this actually Constructor as a python file okay so if you open up any kinds of end project now let me show you so if you go to any kinds of end repository let's say if I open tensorflow tensorflow uh GitHub it's a open source project so I can also see that their code implementation see they have also uh follow the modular approach see if I open any kinds of folder let's say if I open Java folder or let's say python folder now if you just go below you'll see this Constructor file is present here okay why because they have created so many folders you can see so many folders so many folders and inside that they have created different different python file so this folder would be considered as the local package that means they can also import some functionality from this folder let's say I want to import uh let's say this one this particular function let's say this function input a graph dep what I need to do I need to write so what I have to write I have to write from tenser FL do python okay then dot this file and import I want to this uh I want to import this function okay that's how I need to import this file that means instead of writing like all the function in just one file what I'm doing I'm creating a different different folder okay different different let's say component inside that I'm keeping those functionality okay and whenever I need it I'll be using it later on inside my endpoint okay this is called actually modular approach and to uh when whenever you are uh like following this modular approach whenever you are creating this kinds of folder to keep your function in a file make sure you are creating this Constructor file because this folder would be considered as your local package okay because later on you have to import it let's say from tensorflow do python import this function so whenever you will be importing uh make sure your python interpreter will consider this is my local environment okay that's that means I can import something from that folder this is the idea okay so that's why we are creating this Constructor file because SRC is my folder inside that I'll be creating one file called helper. piy okay and helper. Pi inside helper. Pi I'll be writing all the functionality let's say I want to inest the data I want to let's say extract the information I want to download the hugging face model all the functionality I'll be writing inside helper. Pi okay this is the idea now apart from helper. PI I need another file so inside SRC I'll be creating another file called prompt okay prompt. Pi inside that I'm I'm going to write the prompt okay prompt whatever prompt actually I need The Prompt let's say whatever system prompt I'll be using inside that I can write it here now I want to create a EnV file then I want to create a requirement. txt file oh sorry requirement is already created I can remove it as of now I don't need it I want to get up setup. P file why setup. P file because I want to install these are the folder as my local package for this I need setup.py okay previously I think I already explained this part then app.py then I want to create a folder called research inside that I want to create a jupyter notebook file that means trials. i1b so inside that first of all we'll be doing the jupit notebook experiment that means the entire project we'll be implementing through jupit notebook then we'll try to convert everything as our modular coding okay this is the idea so this is my list of the files and folder I need now I have written a simple python logic let me show you guys it's not a very fancy code it's a simple python code I have written so this code it will Loop through this list one by one that means it will Loop through this list one by one see I'm looping through the list it will give you the file path the entire file path then you giving this path to the path function why you are giving to the path function because see here we're using Windows machine and windows by default use backward slash I think you know see if I if I click here see windows by default use backward slash but which slash actually we using here we are using forward slash okay but in Linux Mac actually uh they will be using uh this forward slash but in Windows you have to use backward slash so that's why to uh I overcame this issue we we are using path uh actually path library from path Le see how it will work so let me show you one example so first of all I will open up my python okay now here let me first of all UT so from path Le okay import path okay then let's define a path here so I'll just write p is equal to test let's say slash uh T do PI okay let's say this is my uh folder inside that I'm having one file now what I will do okay it has given me one error let me see the okay so test is not defined that means I need to give inside double quotation because it's a path now so it should be a string type data now fine okay now if I give this P to my path uh function now see what will happen it will automatically detect my operating system based on that it will convert that part see it has given me Windows path it has automatically detected my operating system based on that it will convert this path to the windows path let's say you are using Linux you are using Mac automatically this path would be converted to that operating system okay so that's why instead of manually giving that path as a backward slash what I can do I can give to the path function path will automatically take care that means we can execute this project in any kinds of operating system okay otherwise uh in some of the operating system you will might get some issue okay that's why we have to always handle these kinds of scenario got it so whenever you are designing your software make sure you are handling the these kinds of scenario and you are making your application more robust that means in production it won't be failing whenever it is failing in the production this is not a robust application always you need to take care then after that what I'm doing I'm just splitting my folder name as well as the file name with the help of this actually function so inside operating system paath doit so what path. spit will do it will split your folder name and your file name that means inside this f file directory it will uh give the folder name inside the file name it will give the file name only Okay so you can also execute and test so let me show you so let's say this is my path now so this is my folder and this is my file now if I use first of all let me import operating system so if I give W do path dolit okay inside that I'll will give the P now see if I hit enter it will give me one tle see so in the first item it should be my folder and the second item it should be my file okay and this is what actually I'm storing inside two variable okay two variable I'm doing the couple unpacking here okay I hope is clear then first of all I have to create the folder okay I have to create the folder and to create the folder I'm using w. make directories so first of all I'm checking whether this file directory it is empty or not if it is not empty that means definitely I have some file folder name here so I'm creating the folder you can see then I'm performing the login operation I'm just doing the login in my terminal I'm telling creating a directory file directory from the for the file of file name okay this is the log message actually I'm printing in my terminal then after that I'm also creating the file that means folder creation is done then inside the folder I also need to create the file for this I have written this code actually first of all I have to check whether this file path is exist or not if it is not exist that means if it is not created I have to create it otherwise it is already created no I don't need to create it and I also check the size of the file path that means the file it is zero or not let's see if it is not zero that means inside that file I have written some code so I don't need to delete that file again let's say you want to create again it won't be replacing that file instead of that it will skip that file so that's why also checking the size if size is empty I'm creating this file you can see and I'm doing the long information otherwise I'm telling this file is already exist okay so this is the simple python code I have written now see the power of this script okay see the magic now left hand side see there is nothing there is no folder structure no file now if I execute this script now see what will happen I'll clear I'll simply execute this template. Pi file see template. Pi uh see automatically it will create the folder structure for me got it so it's just a one time effort guys you have to like write this code only one time and later on you can use it uh every time let's say you want to create another project copy this file right execute it will automatically create a folder structure for you let's say in future I need some more more actually let's say uh folder or let a file that's I need another file called test.py I'll just add it here make sure you are giving inside a string okay and you are giving a comma here because it's a list okay now see I'll execute it again it will automatically create that form see test. Pi is also created that's how you can add as much as file and folder you need okay it will automatically create you don't need to manually create it here okay this is the Advan to use this template. Pi file guys okay I hope it is clear now you can check it out since resource this trial do i1b file is created now inside SRC init created helper created prom created okay you can see init created helper created prom created ENB also created app created setup. Pi is created okay everything has created so now let's set up our project as my local package Okay so so for this I'll be writing the setup. pi code and this is a simple code guys I think previously I also shared so this is the setup.py code first of all give the project name that means the package name you want to give let's say tvi project because if I show you currently in my terminal uh inside my environment this uh package is not present so I'll just write P list see genv project is not there okay so I have to install as a genbi project okay for this we'll be using the setup. pi now give the version author name email okay and find package will try to find this uncore init.py and whenever this init.py is present it will consider this folder as my local package okay let me show you now to install this one you need to give one command inside requirement. file called hypen e space dot okay hypen is space this is the command now let me save now let me again install the requirements now see automatically it will install as my local package now see one a info file would be created here and whenever this EG info file is created that means this uh project has been set up as my local package let me show you now if I again do the P list operation now see Genera VI should be there see gener project is there now it is my local package okay that means now I can import anything from this SRC itself got it so this is the entire idea now let's commit the code in my GitHub guys so for this I'm going to open up my G bash and here I'm going to write one command called G add then G commit typen M now let's give one comit message let's say folder structure added then let's do the push operation so get push origin main okay now it has pushed now if I want to check let's go back our GitHub now let's refresh now see it is pushed in my GitHub and readme is also updated now you can copy all the command and you can execute in your system okay I hope it is clear great now the first thing we'll be doing the notebook experiment okay first of all we'll be implementing the entire project in our jupyter notebook then we'll be converting as our modular coding and after implementing jupyter notebook only you just need to copy paste operation okay that's it now first of all let me select the Kel so I already created one environment called medbot okay so let's select it h now Let's test whether this working or not so I'll give one print statement let's a print okay so this notebook should work now it is telling just try to install some IP 1B cardal package so let me install because I'm using jupyter notebook inside my vs code for this you need some additional package and it will automatically install for you so it will take some time after that you will see that execution would be completed so let's wait okay guys so as you can see execution is completed and it is giving me okay message okay it's fine now one thing I just wanted to show you let's say if I show you my project working directory right now let's say PWD so I'm inside this resarch folder okay inside resarch folder but I want to load my data and that my data would be present inside my data folder let's say I'll create a folder called Data okay inside that I'm going to move the PDF I'm having let me move quickly so guys as you can see inside data folder I'm having the PDF okay PDF document now see whenever you are implementing any project make sure you are working in the project directory okay that means your root project directory so this is my root project directory but currently I'm inside this resarch for but if I want to go get back okay inside my project working directory so what I have to do I have to execute one Moree command so let me import operating system package inside operating system you are having something called change directory okay let me show you so OS do CHD that mean change directory to hire one folder back so for this you can write do dot slash okay do do slash means so do do slash means it will get back one folder back okay let me show you now if I execute now if I again show you the PWD project working directory now now see I'm inside my root project folder itself okay so that's how actually you can check the folder location first of all okay otherwise what will happen you will get like path issue sometimes you'll get there's a data not found and so on okay so that to prevent this issue actually make sure you are working in the project folder directory always okay this is the Su I want to give you so first of all let's import some of the library here so here I'm importing uh langin from langin actually I'm importing P PDF loader and directory loader because I told you I will be using PDF documents and to load the PDF documents I need this P PDF loader it is present inside a directory okay that's why I have given directory loader then I also need to perform chunking operation and to perform the sing operation I can use recursive character text splitter okay I think you already familiar with these are the thing now let me import all of them now here to load the PDF here I have written a function let me show you so this is the function I have written guys okay extract the data from the PDF itself so the function name is load PDF it will take the actually data directory okay data directory and it will only load the PDF documents okay it will only load the PDF document let's say you want to load the docs document txt document at that time you can give the extension here fine so with of P PDF loader it will extract the information from the PDF itself okay and whatever uh let information it will extract it will give give me as a documents okay you can see now let me show you let me execute so it will return me extracted data so here I've given the path okay so it should be data okay data directory now let me show you so if I execute now see it is extracting all the information from the PDF of itself and it is having almost 700 actually pages so it will take some time so let's wait so guys as you can see my extraction is done now if I show you the extracted data see this is the entire extracted data actually you got okay from all the pages it will show you the data now let me comment it as of now H now what I have to do I have to uh perform the chunking operation because you remember see the architecture I have extracted the documents now I have to perform the chunking operation okay and to perform the chunking operation I will be using recursive text splitter so with that I have created another function here so split the data into text chunks so it will take the extracted data it will perform the chunking operation you can see so here is the code so chunk size is 5 500 and chunk over leave is 20 I have given and it will perform the chunking operation and it will give you the chunk results okay now let me show you so now if I execute the function and if I show you the length of the text chunks now see you got 7,000 20 chunks here guys 7,20 chunks you got just try to see how much data actually you have in the PDF okay and this is enough information to create one medical chat bot I believe that fine that's why I taken this big data guys now see this is the inter chance actually I got now what I have to do I have to use one embedding model to like perform the vector embedding and this embedding I'll be storing to the knowledge base that means inside my Pine con Vector database okay so now let's download one embedding model mod from the hugging face okay so here is the function I have written guys download hugging face embedding model now for this I need to import this package first of all let me import so this is the package guys hugging face embedding I'm importing from the Lang chain embedding okay now let me execute H now this function will automatically download one embedding model see this is the embedding model I want to use let me show you this embedding model so this is present inside hugging phase so the name of the model is all mini LM L6 V2 so this is one actually embedding model and it will give you Vector dimensional 3804 Dimension four dimensional Vector actually it will return you and this Dimension you need because whenever you are using pine con Vector database you need to also mention the dimension of the vector like like what is your vector Dimension whenever you are creating the clust now whenever you are creating the index that time you have to mention this Dimension so that's why always try to remember whenever you are using pine con Vector database try to see what kinds of let's say embedding model you are using and that embedding model uh Returns what kinds of dimensional Vector just try to see the documentation you will al already get it fine now let me download the embedding model so let me execute this function I'll download the embeding model see it is downloading from the hugging pH Hub so it will take some time let's wait so guys you can see my model has downloaded okay now let's test the model whether it is able to convert my sentence to Vector embedding or not so for this I've given one sentence here hello world and there is a function called embed query so it will automatically give you the vector embedding and I'm also checking the length whether it is giving me 384 dimensional vector or not now see if I execute the program now see length is 384 and if you want to see the vector see this is the complete Vector actually you got okay I hope it is clear now let me comment this line as of now got it now what I have to do guys I have to initialize my pine cone uh inside pine cone actually I have to store these are the vector okay the complete Vector actually I'll be generating from my Tex chunks so for this let's open up my pine cone so if you want to open up the pine con just write P con. so this is the website and make sure you created One account guys just do the sign up operation with your email address you can create an account so for me I already have one account let me login so guys as you can see this is my Pine con uh website okay this is the interface of the pine con and this is one of the amazing Vector database provider guys you will be loving a lot even I personally like it so here what I have to do guys I have to create a index that means I have to create a cluster in that cluster actually I'll be saving all of my Vector they have also given the quick uh start like how can set up the pine cone how we can let's say store the data see all the code example they have also given okay so we'll be following the same approach to store our embeddings to the Pine con but before that you have to collect one API key so how to collect the API key left hand side you can see one API key option is there just try to click here for me I already created one API key if you don't have just try to create API key just give the name let's say I'll give test or you can give any name let's create the API key okay so this is the API key now just try to copy the API key guys and try to mention inside this this EnV file so I'll open the EnV file so let me paste it here and make sure you are giving one key name here that means this is your Pine con API key okay that's it and make sure you are writing this thing in a stream got it h now let me open up my trials. IP andb now what I will do I'll just create a cluster here so let me go back to the database and don't share this key with anyone guys otherwise they will be also able to access your account okay I'll REM it after this recording so for you don't need to share with anyone now inside pine cone either you can manually create the index let's say you can click here create index let's create one index let's say I want to create uh let say anything you can give test now Dimension let's say 300 and 84 the same Dimension I will give here the dimension actually I'm getting cosine Matrix just keep it you can also select different different Matrix like what kinds of let's say similarity Matrix it will apply whenever it will do the semantic SS operation I want to use cosine score now now just keep it everything as default you don't need to change the provider see AWS is the free one if you let's say sign up for the first time you can create one to two cluster here with the help of AWS cloud provider but if you want to take this premium subscription that means if you want to create a multiple cluster if want to take some more space you can see see if you're using free plan you will get 2 GB storage here but if you have more than 2 GB data that time you have to take the premium subscription okay that time actually what you have to do you have to take their plan subscription plan let's see if I take this one one uh Google Cloud now see see the price plan see this is the price plan actually they have so with respect to that you can also purchase there uh let's say machine okay but as of now I'll be using the free free services only I don't need the let's say premium subscription of the pine con but if you are creating the actual project if you need more spaces that time you can do it so I'll be selecting the AWS cloud provider and Reon just keep it everything as default only just need to give the name okay name and a dimension that's it 384 okay now let's create the index so this is the manual approach to create the index guys okay this is the manual approach see this index is getting created it is getting initialized and once it is initialized see it will be connected okay see it is now connected okay now if you want to connect it you can execute this python code and you can insert your data all the conf code they have already given okay but I don't want to create this index manually I want to create through the python code so let me delete it so if you want to delete you just click here and try to delete the index so you have to give the name okay I'll beting because I will be creating through the python code and how to like create through the python code guys I think they have already given one stter code remember so here you can give the uh index name like which index you want to create and create index Dimension you can give here Matrix serverless AWS region okay everything you can pass here so now let's use this approach to create the index so what I'll do I'll go back to my vs code and I already prepared this code for you so let me show you so this is the code only you just need to change the API key so let me change the API key the API key I have collected here let me copy and let me change it here or I think I can read it from the environment only so what I can do I can import the environment just a minute so let's import so from EnV import load EnV okay then I will load the EnV now simply I'll get this Pine con API key from my environment and here it will save inside this variable now this variable actually I'll pass here okay so no body won't be able to see my API key that time so this is the best approach guys you can also follow now you can give the index name let's say I'll give medical bot medical bot let's say this is my index name and here you have to give the dimension so make sure which uh actually U embedding model you're using and what is the dimension size 384 that means it's fine 384 keep everything as default cosine s a US one okay no need to change anything because we are using free cluster here fine now once you will execute this code okay once you will execute this code you will see that uh your U index would be automatically created in the pine con let me show you so if I see if I execute discorde now see what will happen so guys execution is done now if I get back to my Pine con and if I refresh it here see medical chatboard should be created here let me show you see medical chatbot is created automatically it has created and now it is active and running okay now what I can do I can uh convert our uh let's say chunks to the vector embedding and I can store inside the pon Vector database so for this uh what I can do so for this first of all set this pine cone uh API key as as your environment variable because uh whenever we'll be storing the let's say data to the Pine con so Pine con internally looks for this API key inside the environment variable okay so for this we are using operating system Environ okay Environ and this is the key name guys I've giving and I'm setting my Pine con API key okay whatever API key I'm loading from my EnV file so it will set inside my envirment variable right now okay so whenever I'll execute my Pine con code I don't need to like again and again pass it okay again and again I don't need to pass it here this is the advantage now see to store the vector embedding this is the code snippit you have to execute guys so you can see this is the Cod snipp it let me comment here now I'm importing Lin Pine con import Pine con vectory store okay now inside Pine con vectory store you have one function called from documents so first of all you have to give the documents that means my text chunks the text chunks I have created remember so this is the text chunks I have created okay so this text chunks you have to give then you have to give the index name so what is the index name I have given guys I think remember this is the index name that means this index name it is already created that means inside this index it will store the data got it so make sure you check this other the variable now I need to give the embedding model so I think remember we downloaded one embedding model OKAY from the hugging fa got it so this three parameter you have to pass here now see if I execute this line if I execute this line it will convert all of my data to the vector embedding and will restore to the uh Pine con Vector database and how many chunks I got guys I think remember I got 7,20 chunks that means 7,20 chunks Vector will be restored inside my pine cone so it will take some time guys let's wait after execution after executing this code I'll pause the video and once this Vector will get store in my Pine con I will come back again see let me show you if I go to my Pine con right now and if you refresh the page here see all of the vector would be stored here even you can also see the count let me show you see as of now 864 let's say chunks has been added now see th000 now see you can also see the visualization of the vector it's amazing right so whenever you used to use local vector it was not possible to visualize our Vector but here it is possible you can see you can also see the score that means um centic score like what is the score between this Vector this vector and this Vector got it this is one amazing visualization guys you will get in the pine cone and see this is the entire Vector representation of this entire sentence okay entire text okay and even it is also showing the page page number with in which page it is extracting the data and what is the PDF name as well okay every information you can see here even you can also perform the qud operation that means the way you perform the SQL qu you can also perform the qu operation here manually everything is possible but everything we'll be doing through the python code I'm not going to use the manual approach here now see the vector count guys so 4, 120 Vector has been stored now let's wait uh once it has saved all my all of my Vector dor I'll come back and I'll show you so guys as you can see my execution is completed now if I get back to my pine cone and if I refresh see all of the vector it has stored here like more than 7,000 Vector it has stored inside my Pine con index okay now what I can do I can use this uh index as my knowledge base that means we'll be connecting my large language model with this knowledge base and we'll be asking the query and it will do the semantic search operation here okay this is the idea now let's get back to my code editor now see I already created the index and I already stored my Vector there now I want to load my existing okay existing index if you want to load the index existing index what you can do you can use this code cipit okay see again I'm importing Pine con Vector from Lang and pine con and there is another function called from existing index okay from existing index you have to give the index name so the index name I've given the same index name and you have to pass the embedding model the embedding model you have downloaded now see if you execute this line of code it will load the index that means whatever index you have created and all the vector actually it will load and it will give you the doc Source doc Source object okay this is an object doc Source object now you can also perform the retrieve operation here that me you can perform the similarity Source operation here let me show you one example there's a doc as rever sear type similarity search keyword three that means it will give you three relevant answer let me show you so if I initialize my R object and now I will ask one question here so this is my medical data I will ask let's say what is acne okay acne so I think you know inside this PDF I'm having acne related dis dis also let me show you so if I press contrl F acne so guys as you can see this is the acne disease what is acne and all so you can see acne and acne related actually treatment okay medicine they have suggested each and everything so I asking one question here so what is acne it should give me the relevant uh answer okay for the acne from my knowledge base now let me execute and let me show you now see if I show you this Rel uh rate docs it will give you three results actually three results even it is also showing the source okay from where it is it has referred now see different different actually uh acne related response it has given me okay because I have set SAR keyword is equal to three it will only give me three response okay but I don't need these kinds of output I need a complete let's say definition okay what is act name got it so for this what I have to do guys I I think you remember I have to integrate my large language model that means here we'll be working on user will give the query this query will go to knowledge Bas knowledge will give the rank results I'll be using the large language model so LM will process this rank result as well as the query and it will give me the correct response okay so for this let's initialize my model so I already told you we'll be using open model so open so let's initialize my model and I think you already know what is temperature and Max token so it is giving you one error okay it is giving me error because I haven't set my open API key so let's set the open API key I'll open up my environment so here is my API key guys so make sure you create one API key and just try to paste here and similar wise I also need to set this API key as in my environment variable okay so let me execute this code mm so here what I can do I can duplicate this line and here I can write open API key so it will also give me my open a key then here whenever I'm setting as an environment here I can also change open a key open I key okay now let's set this one okay string expected non time why okay so I think I have to load it every uh again then I have to execute now it should work now it is working fine now if I get back here now if I initialize it it should work see successfully have initialized my large language model now I have to create the complete chain for this let's import some Library previously I showed you now how to create the rag application there I think you remember we were importing this uh Library create T chain create stop document chain okay create promp chat promp template okay everything I already showed you there so we are importing the same code here now this is going to be my system prompt so here I want to give this prompt in my language model OKAY large language model now I'm going to create the complete prompt prompt template you can see this is the system pront and whatever input user will give that means the input actually I have given it will come here and it will give you the complete output now let me initialize now let's create my chain so create a stop chain inside that you have to give the llm as well as the prompt and whatever object you will get in inside create retal CH you have to pass it as well as the ret that means your vector isore the vector hisory you created okay object now let's initialize my chain now let's ask the question so here I will give what is acne okay what is acne sorry acne now see see the response guys see acne is a common skin disease characterized by pulse on the face chest and back it is caused by uh clogged force and become inflamed due to the oil dead skin cells okay and bacteria treatment uh and so on see that means it has given me the correct response if you open the PDF now this book right now and if you read it here you'll see that it it has given me the correct response now see if I giving any other question which is not relevant about the PDF what will happen see now see if I give any other let's say question let's say I have given what is stats that means what is statistics it is telling me I don't know because here I have given the now so if you if you're not getting the context that means here this question I'm asking this is out of context that means the data I have given to my model OKAY the knowledge Bas I have given uh to my model so this information is not available here so that's why it is telling I don't know okay so this is the complete custom uh actually system we have created like custom chatbot we have created which is only referring our custom data okay I hope it is clear so guys this is actually entire demo like that's how actually be implementing the entire application now you can ask any kinds of question let me show you so you can take any other disase let me show you or let's take any other disase okay let's take this dise actually this one I'll copy and I'll come back here then I'll ask here now let's see see uh it is giving you the response growth hormones resulting the abnormal growth okay see that means this is the correct response actually I'm getting now if you see the image so the same thing okay so you can see um this disase is a abnormal releases particular chemical from the blah blah blah okay so you can read it so that means we are getting the correct response fine now let's try to convert this project as our end to end uh implementation right now that means we'll be also implementing the UI but before that I have to first of all create the modular coding okay so what I'll do guys I will first of all open up my help .p inside H.P whatever let's say uh utility code I have written let's say loading the data then U creating the chunks then loading the embedding model all the function I will move inside this ala. Pi so let me open so inside that I'm going to import all of the library see I just copy pasted the code from my notebook only if you open the notebook the same code actually I'm composting and why is giving the error because below you can see I have to select my environment the correct environment let's say medical bot now this error will be disappeared now see all the function I'll just copy paste here all the three function I have written now my load PDF then uh this one text split and this one my load embedding model so here I kept all the function you can see because I want to UT from here so these are the function I don't want to create inside my endpoint otherwise my code base would be like messy right that's why I am creating inside this particular file now let me save and inside prompt actually what I will do I'll give the system prompt whatever prompt actually have written so here is the prompt guys I think you remember I'll copy The Prompt and inside prompt. Pi I'm going to mention it here okay so from here I'm going to open the prompt let's see in future us uh you want to change the prompt you want to give any other prompt you can open this prompt. P you can change here it will reflect in your code okay no need to open your actual code implementation that time and so let me close this at the tab as of now it's not required now yeah so helper is fine now what I will do I will create another file here and I will name it as store _ index uhp okay P why because let's say you want to update this book let's say you want to add some more information that time again you have to store all the embeddings to the knowledge base that means inside your Pine con yes or no right and to store it I again need to execute one like end point that means stoore index. Pi whenever you will execute it it will load the new information and it will store to the vector database again fine so for this what I will do I'll prepare this one so see whatever code I have written now here that means I extracted my U let's say documents I created the chunks downloaded theing model after that I pushed everything to my Vector database okay see all the let's Vector database code I have written everything I need to write inside Daton so let me import all of the library so you can see I'm importing from SRC help part that means from SRC help part so inside helper I'm having three function load PDF then text split and download Face embeddings okay see I'm importing all of them hugging for embeding okay then I'm also importing Pine con then Pine con Vector store then load ENB and operating system first of all I have to set my environment variable that means my credential okay open sorry Pine con API credential then I'll be loading my data extracting the data creating the chunks then I'll be loading the m bding model see load file that means I'm loading the data so I have to give the data location so this is my data location then Tex pter will run then download the embeding mod okay then after that I will initialize my pine cone code base the same code guys if you open the Jupiter notebook file the same code see Pine con initialization it will create the medical chat board okay Medical Board that means this bot it will create okay then uh it will actually uh create the index then it will store the embeddings okay so at the very first time you have to execute this line guys okay very first time you have to execute this file then uh whatever actually let's say data you are having it will uh do the vector conversion that means aing conversion then it will store to the vector database okay now what I'll do I'll just delete my previous embeddings whatever I created uh this uh cluster I I want to delete it because I now I'm doing the modular coding now so I'll be executing everything from my modular coding itself now let me remove it it now see it will delete it after sometimes you'll see that it won't be visible here now see make sure guys before launching your application first of all you need to execute this store index. Pi make sure this index should be created otherwise you won't be able to do the query operation right so at the very first time you have to execute this store index. Pi okay then you will be launching your application that means app.py and this this one you have to only execute one time not multiple time multi time when you will be executing whenever you will update the data let's say you want to add any other data one more PDF that time you'll be executing this file okay otherwise just keep it as default that's it now let me save now I think this is deleted now see there is nothing now what I'll do uh let me show you how it will create everything so I'll open up my terminal let me clear now let's execute this store index. Pi python store index. by now let's execute see it will perform all the operation whatever things we have done in the jupyter notebook so let's wait after sometimes you'll see that your uh index would be created and inside index all the vector would be stored so guys as you can see my uh index is created now if I open it up inside that uh now it will store the embeddings one by one all the embeddings it will sa so guys as you can see my execution is completed and it's it has stored all of my Vector now that means my uh this store index is working fine I'm successfully able to store my Vector now let's create the endpoint okay that means my um I mean main application so user will uh uh start this application right now so here I already told you we will be using flask okay so here I already told you we'll be using flask here and if I'm using flask I need a HTML and CSS code to create the um one beautiful user interface so I already created one HTML and CSS code for you guys if you don't know it's completely fine again I'm telling you there are so many template you will get over the Internet there is a website called bootstrap previously I also told you I think bootstrap okay bootstrap website so from here you will get different different example even you can also see different different template it is having even if you search like chatbot HTML CSS free template free template you will get different different actually template see different different template you can also download The Source course even see code is also visible you can also download even you will get some website see different different chat template okay different different chat template you can use it okay it's up to you now what I will do I'll uh quickly just show you the HTML CSS code I have prepared for this I think you know if you're using flask you need to create one folder here called template okay templates so inside that you have to create a file call index. HTM okay now let me show you my HTML code I have prepared or it's a chat bot what I can do I can name it as chat. HTML okay chat. HTML now this is the entire HTML code guys I prepared okay save it now I need to create another folder for the CSS called startic so these are the requirement folder for the um flask if you're using flask inside python you need to create this the folder inside startic I'll be creating a file call style. CSS okay now let me also paste the CSS code I copied from the internet okay so this is one basic template I created now whenever I will uh show you my application you will see the user interface whatever the user interface I created now let me create my endpoint app.py now inside app.py I'll be integrating all of the functionality I have prepared so far so first of all let me all the requirement package all the required package actually one by one so so here I'm using flask so I have imported flask from the flask I imported all the required functionality you can see then imported uh download hugging face embedding model okay because I need the embedding object to load my Vector restore I think you know that I need to load this not this actually pine cone index now so where is the pine code index so here is the pine Cod index so I need to load this index and to load this index what I need I need the let's say this one embedding object I think remember at the last I showed you loading exist index okay I think you need it okay I think you remember fine so that is why I have to uh import it then I'm importing you can see Pine code store openi rable keyway that means whatever let's say I was loading here here these are the thing I'm loading everything fine then I also need to load my prompt so prompt is available inside my prompt. Pi here so I I can UT it so simply I can inut just write prompt SRC do prompt import that means I want to start everything inside that file okay that's it then I also need something called operating system so import voice that's it now let me initialize my flask to initialize the flask you have to use this code go to the flask documentation you will get it now let's set all of my openi and pine environment okay for this I need to use the clading environment package that's it then I will be downloading the embedding model then I will uh first of all initialize my embedding object then I will load my existing uh index from my Pine phone so let me show you see the same code from The Notebook I copied see so I'm loading the existing index Medical Board make sure name is correct Medical Board yeah it's correct then it will give me the retriever object then I'm loading the open a model then creating the prom template then after that I'm creating the chain okay now now I have to create two route exactly first route would be my default route that means user will get the interface of my application chat. HTML would be rendered got it now second route I'll be doing for the chat operation that means user is giving any query to the chatbot so that message actually I'll be accepting and this message I will give to my llm okay that means you can see I'm doing the inbo operation okay so same inbo operation I'm performing let me show you so here is the inbo operation M okay in and whatever response I'm getting I'm printing it as well as I'm showing in in my uh that user interface okay that's it now let me execute my application so I'm running on my Local Host port number 80 de is equal to that means if you change anything it will automatically update everything so now let me show you my application so let's open up my terminal so I'll just execute python app.py sorry it should be python spelling is not okay python okay now it should be running now see just give the allow permission now see your application is running now let's open up our Google uh Google Chrome search for local host port number 8080 see guys this is the interface we have created and this is one amazing uh interface guys you can see amazing um chat template we have created uh because many people have requested me just try to create one front end part of our application as well beautiful front end part and that's how you can create a beautiful front end part now here you can ask any kind of question let's say I will ask the same question I'll ask what is acne the acne is a common uh skin disease by characteristic by pimples on the face fine then I will ask another question let's say I got fever what should I do see now this is the response if you are experiencing high fever it is important to seek the medical attention Okay so tell me some medicine now see it is also suggesting some medicine okay related fever now you can ask any kinds of question from the let's say PDF itself any kinds of disease you can ask let's say this is the disease I want to ask I'll just copy and here I'll just write what is this disas and all about see it has uh given me the response okay now you can read this uh I mean PDF and you can see that you can ask the medicine uh you can ask for the treatment anything you can ask so this is our chatbot guys this is our medical chatbot we have created and see it is also giving you the one beautiful user interface okay it is also returning now what we'll do we'll just try to also deploy this application guys but before that we'll be implementing some more endn projects then after that I'll uh keep one uh dedicated endn let's say deployment session there I'll will show you how we can deploy these are the project on the cloud platform okay so yes guys I hope you liked it but before that what I will do guys I will comment Des are the code in my GitHub so you can also comit from the vs code let's comit from here I light U updated let's comment and VMV file would be automatically ignored by the git ignore okay because inside git ignore you have already mentioned it do git ignore would be ignored see would be ignored okay so it w be published inside my GitHub now if I open up my GitHub now if I refresh see all the code has been updated now I can write the further Cod uh let's step as well in the read me file okay so I have added all the step like after that what you have to do uh after that you can uh set your uh uh environment key then run store index then app.py then you just need to local up open up your Local Host okay now let me comment the changes as well so read me updated and make sure guys you start this uh repository all of you start this repository you can also forkit so that you will have the reference okay now if I refresh now see read me is updated and you can see all the step I have also added that's how you can also prepare your read me file so that so that if other people is referring your let's say GitHub they will be also able to set up this code okay in their system as well fine so yes guys this is the complete implementation I hope you liked it so that's how we can create any kinds of n to gen VI B project fine and no need to worry I'll also show you the deployment even we will be also discussing about LM Ops uh with the help of LM Ops also will'll be learning how we can access any can open source D language model okay as a hosted open source lar language model we can use it so yes guys this is all about from this video if you liked it so please uh try to subscribe to to the Channel Try to like it and try to share it so thanks for watching and I will see you next timein this video you will learn how to create a virtual environment with python in Windows now open a terminal and this is where you're going to type ion minus M ven V and then in the next argument you're going to type where you want to store this virtual environment and I'm going to store it in the folder V EnV press enter and now vs code will ask you we notice the new environment has been created do you want to select it for the workspace folder and you want to do this so click on yes and now you will see here at the bottom of your screen that python has switched to the virtual environment so you can choose here between the global python version and the python version installed in the virtual environment now what's important is that python is still installing any libraries in the global python environment and if you want to change that we have to activate this environment so we're going to type VNV SL scripts SL activate and press enter and now you will see that I'm getting an error unauthorized access and if you're getting this error as well you're going to type the following commands that you can find in the description of this video press enter and now we're going to try to activate the virtual environment again so type V andv scripts activate and press enter and you will see that the virtual environment has been created and now you will see V and V before any line in the terminal\""
